INSTALLATION

    Install ZOE's directory wherever you see fit. The application stores 
    its data under the same directory. Plan accordingly.


GETTING STARTED

    On most platforms, double click Zoe.jar. This will start the
    application and open your web browser. Loading the application may take
    a little while.

    Alternatively, you can start the application from the command line:

    java -jar Zoe.jar

    If the application cannot open your web browser, you can connect to it 
    directly:

    http://127.0.0.1:10080/

    Follow the online instruction to set up the application.


UNINSTALL

    If the application is running, quit it first (zoe -> services -> 
    application). Then delete its directory.
